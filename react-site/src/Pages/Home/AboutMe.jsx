                    My name is Caleb Appiagyei and I am an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech who is passionate about the ever growing field of Computer Science.

                    <p className="about--section--description">
                    I am very excited about the avenues that can be created through the field and am determined to continue my exploration into the various aspects that it comes with so that I can further expand upon my expertise. My goal is to eventually contribute to work that can improve the quality of life for the people in our community. As technology continues to grow in its impact on our daily lives, I strongly believe that technology is the best way to go about accomplishing this goal.
